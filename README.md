# SRPI
 some random python initializer v0.1

## What is this?
This is a test program i made that basically is a user menu installer thing.
It has a menu where you can input something like "I_req" and it will download required packages automatically.

## Why did i make this?
Mostly for fun. However i wanted to create a tool that people can use to easily do something idk.

Code is REALLY unoptimized or generally bad.
Use if you want.
Updates coming soon.
